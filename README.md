  <p align="center">
    An Amazon Clone website example built with NextJS. For now it's called an amazon clone, but maybe in the future I might repurpose the entire project into a different name and style.
    <br />
  There are still a lot of things to be <b>fixed</b>, was focusing on the backend more since frontend is not my thing.

## About The Project

I was really bored so I just decided I would create somewhat of an Amazon Clone. I was only doing backend since I realized I didn't have that much time to play around with the frontend. A lot of features are not very well tested.

<b>Some Features:</b>
- Server-Side Rendering
- Form Validation using React Hook Form
- Peermission based lists
- Cart:
  - Removing from cart, adding to cart, changing quantity, moving to save for later, adding to a list, and checkout.
- Account:
  - Account Info(not finished), Prime(not added), Changing password, Lists, Addresses, Payment Methods
- Searchbar using Algolia
- Search results using Algolia
- Order history:
  - Track, Return or Replace, Share Gift Receipt, Leave Seller Feedback (Not implemented yet)
- Many more...
